    <string name="about_text">Hi! My name is Jeroen and I developed this app in the first weeks that I became vegan. I found it annoying to browse websites in the store to find out whether products were vegan or not. With this app, I hope to support others in their quest for an animal-friendly lifestyle. \n\nA list like this will never be finished nor flawless. If you miss information or find an error, please let me know by sending an email to contactisitvegan@gmail.com.</string>
